# CareFront Frontend Scripts

This directory contains the Angular frontend located in [`care-plus/`](care-plus/). When running `npm` commands from Windows PowerShell or a terminal, make sure to execute them either inside the `care-plus` folder or via the helper scripts defined in the top-level `package.json`.

## Quick start

```powershell
cd CareFront
npm install   # installs dependencies in CareFront/care-plus
npm run dev   # runs ng serve from the care-plus project
```

These scripts delegate to the Angular CLI located in `care-plus`, so you no longer need to navigate into the subdirectory manually.
